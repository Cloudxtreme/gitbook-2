# Rules System

This is a list of the current server rules in the table [rule\_values](../database/rule_values) and their descriptions.

To set the value in the database the name must have the category prepended, with a colon in between e.g. to Change MaxLevel, update the rule\_value of the row with a rule\_name of Character:MaxLevel
